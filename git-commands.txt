Step-by-Step Git Workflow:

git add .
Stages all changes (new, modified, and deleted files) in the current directory for the next commit.

git commit -m "Initial commit"
Commits the staged changes with a message ("Initial commit").

git remote -v
Displays the list of remote repositories linked to the local repository, along with their URLs.

git branch -M main
Renames the current branch to main. The -M flag forces the rename, even if the branch already exists.

git push -u origin main
Pushes the main branch to the remote repository (origin) and sets it as the upstream branch for future pushes/pulls.

git push origin main --force
Force pushes the main branch, overwriting the remote branchâ€™s history if necessary.

git pull origin main --rebase
Pulls the latest changes from origin/main and applies them on top of local commits (avoiding unnecessary merge commits).

Additional Git Commands:

git branch
Lists all branches in the local repository.

git checkout master
Switches to the master branch (if it exists in the local repo).

git branch -M main
Renames the current branch to main (similar to step 4).

git push -u origin main --force
Forcefully pushes the main branch to origin and sets it as the upstream branch.

git push -u origin HEAD:main
Pushes the current branch (HEAD) to the remote main branch, setting it as the upstream.

Example Usage:
Let's assume you are initializing a new Git repository and pushing your code to GitHub:

# Step 1: Initialize a Git repository (if not initialized)
git init
 
# Step 2: Add all files to staging
git add .
 
# Step 3: Commit the changes
git commit -m "Initial commit"
 
# Step 4: Connect the local repo to a remote GitHub repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
 
# Step 5: Verify the remote URL
git remote -v
 
# Step 6: Rename the current branch to 'main'
git branch -M main
 
# Step 7: Push the 'main' branch to GitHub and set it as upstream
git push -u origin main
 
# Step 8: Force push (if required, e.g., overwriting history)
git push origin main --force
 
# Step 9: Pull the latest changes from the remote repository with rebase
git pull origin main --rebase

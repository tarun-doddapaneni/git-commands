Step-by-Step Git Workflow:

git add .
Stages all changes (new, modified, and deleted files) in the current directory for the next commit.

git commit -m "Initial commit"
Commits the staged changes with a message ("Initial commit").

git remote -v
Displays the list of remote repositories linked to the local repository, along with their URLs.

git branch -M main
Renames the current branch to main. The -M flag forces the rename, even if the branch already exists.

git push -u origin main
Pushes the main branch to the remote repository (origin) and sets it as the upstream branch for future pushes/pulls.

git push origin main --force
Force pushes the main branch, overwriting the remote branchâ€™s history if necessary.

git pull origin main --rebase
Pulls the latest changes from origin/main and applies them on top of local commits (avoiding unnecessary merge commits).

Additional Git Commands:

git branch
Lists all branches in the local repository.

git checkout master
Switches to the master branch (if it exists in the local repo).

git branch -M main
Renames the current branch to main (similar to step 4).

git push -u origin main --force
Forcefully pushes the main branch to origin and sets it as the upstream branch.

git push -u origin HEAD:main
Pushes the current branch (HEAD) to the remote main branch, setting it as the upstream.
